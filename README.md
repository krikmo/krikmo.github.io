# [Things](https://krikmo.github.io)

Simple things for simple tasks.

* [**"Random" Password Generator**](https://krikmo.github.io/pass.html) is exactly what you think it is. The special thing is that the passwords are alphanumeric and (maybe) with a few special characters. You can choose its length, but bear with me.
* [**The Coin Flipper**](https://thecoinflipper.github.io) is *also* exactly what you think it is.
* [**Time**](https://krikmo.github.io/time.html) is... wait for it... exactly what you think it is.
