Simple things for simple tasks.

* [**"Random" Password Generator**](https://krikmo.github.io/pass.html) is exactly what you think it is. The special thing is that the passwords are 23 characters long and alphanumeric. Nice.
* [**The Coin Flipper**](https://krikmo.github.io/flip.html) is *also* exactly what you think it is.
* [**Time**](https://krikmo.github.io/time.html) is... wait for it... exactly what you think it is.
