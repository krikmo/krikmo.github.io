# [Things](https://krikmo.github.io)

Simple things for simple tasks.

* [**"Random" Password Generator**](https://krikmo.github.io/pass.html) is exactly what it sounds. The special thing is that they are 23 characters long and alphanumeric. Nice.
* [**The Coin Flipper**](https://krikmo.github.io/flip.html) is *also* exactly what it sounds.
